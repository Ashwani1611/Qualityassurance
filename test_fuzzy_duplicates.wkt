# FUZZY DUPLICATE TEST DATA FOR DBSCAN VALIDATION
# ================================================
# This file contains intentional "fuzzy duplicates" that DBSCAN should detect:
# - Parallel lines with small offsets (GPS noise simulation)
# - Near-collinear segments with slight angular difference
# 
# Coordinate System: Geographic (lat/lon) - similar to Cambridge Large_map.wkt
# Buffer size for detection: 0.00005 (~5m)
#
# EXPECTED RESULTS:
# - GeoPandas: Should detect groups A, B (exact/topological overlaps)
# - DBSCAN: Should ALSO detect groups C, D, E (fuzzy duplicates)
# ================================================

# GROUP A: EXACT DUPLICATES (Both methods should detect)
# A1-A2: Identical lines
